Permissions on Android fall into two camps:

1. Kernel Level (UID, GID)
  - Needed for lower level permission granting and utilises OS level file permissions to regulate access
  - See more at [Kernel Permissions](kernel_perms.md)
2. App level (PackageManager)
  - Involve the PackageManager service
  - See more at [Application Permissions](app_perms.md)
