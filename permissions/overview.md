Permissions on Android fall into two camps:

1. Kernel Level (UID, GID)
2. App level (PackageManager)

The distinction between these are that kernel level permissions are needed for lower level permission granting and utilises OS level file permissions to regulate access.

See more at [Kernel Permissions](kernel_perms.md).

App level permissions involve the PackageManager service.
