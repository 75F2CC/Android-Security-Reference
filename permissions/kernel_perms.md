# Kernel Permissions

- Processes are assigned permissions based upon:
  - The owning user
  - Its PID
  - Its GIDs
  
An interesting example of inspecting a processes permissions can be seen here [Android Security: Welcome To Shell (Permissions)](http://doridori.github.io/Android-Security-welcome-to-shell/)
