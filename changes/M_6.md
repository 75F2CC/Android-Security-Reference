#Security Change Summary for M-6-23

##API changes

- Runtime Permissions

    - Specification of how a key or key pair is secured when imported into the Android Keystore system. 
- Android for Work Changes

##Under the hood changes

- Lockscreen verification
  - With Android 6.0, Lockscreen verification now occurs in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for devices that support a TEE (such as the majority of new devices that launched with Android 6.0). This provides brute force protection with exponentially increasing delays on verification of the userâ€™s lockscreen challenge.
- BoringSSL
- APK Validation
- Full disk encryption is now a requirement for all new Marshmallow devices with adequate hardware capabilities and is also extended to allow encryption of data on SD cards.
- New verified boot ensures your phone is healthy from the bootloader all the way up to the operating system.
- Android security patch level enables you to check and make sure your device has the most recent security updates.
- SELinux enhancements
- `KeyStore`
  - Keys which do not require encryption at rest will no longer be deleted when secure lock screen is disabled or reset (for example, by the user or a Device Administrator). Keys which require encryption at rest will be deleted during these events.
