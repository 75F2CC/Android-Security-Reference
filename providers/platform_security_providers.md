#Platform Security Providers

Security functionality on Android is provided by various open src libs which vary depending on the OS version. There are native libs and java libs with JCE interfaces which coexist. 

##Quick Overview to terms

The crypto side of java has a few abbreviations associated with it, here are the most common ones:

- **JCA** [Java Cryptography Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Cryptography_Architecture)
  - The Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) is a framework for working with cryptography using the Java programming language
  - The JCA uses a "provider"-based architecture (see below)
- **JCE** [Java Cryptography Extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Cryptography_Extension)
  - The Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) is an officially released Standard Extension to the Java Platform and part of Java Cryptography Architecture.  
- **SPI** [Service Provider Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_provider_interface)
  - Service Provider Interface (SPI) is an API intended to be implemented or extended by a third party. It can be used to enable framework extension and replaceable components. 

Guide to terms like JCE & JSSE can be found [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/index-jsp-136007.html).

##Native Implementations

####OpenSSL

- Used since the beginning?
- OpenSSL version used - look in AOSP openSSL version file for each platform tag i.e. 4.3 used 1.0.1e
	
####BoringSSL

- [Source link](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/)		
- "BoringSSL is a fork of OpenSSL that is designed to meet Googleâ€™s needs."
- Transition starting in 6.0

##Java JCE Providers

####Apache Harmonys Crypto Provider
		
- Old and being phased out
- Limited JCE functionality

####AndroidOpenSSL

- Introduced in 4 (SSL function only)
- Highest priority since 4.4
- Covers most of the same function as BC since 4.4
- Since 4.4 has been pulled out of core and can be used as a standalone lib (conscrypt)
- Backed by OpenSSL ( BoringSSL >= 6 ) natively
- Contained in the **Conscrypt** namespace (`com.android.org.conscrypt` on Android)
	- AndroidOpenSSL's [`Provider` def](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/conscrypt/+/android-n-preview-2/src/main/java/org/conscrypt/OpenSSLProvider.java#34) @ N preview v2
	  - Maps crypto def Strings to class definitions which conform to the SPI for that function 
	- AndroidOpenSSL's [SPI concrete class definitions](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/conscrypt/+/android-n-preview-2/src/main/java/org/conscrypt)  @ N preview v2
	  - Java bridge between the crypto SPI and the native [Open|Boring]SSL implementation  
- Was part of `libcore` until 4.4 

####BouncyCastle

- Android used an old version of BC ("[crippled]")
- Was the default security Java Security API provider
- Package was renamed at 3.0. Before this issues if including a newer version of BC (hence [SC](https://rtyley.github.io/spongycastle/))
- Offered full JCE functionality
- Unsure how much (if any) functionality delegated to native (i.e. [Open|Boring]Ssl) implementation. Should look at the CSPRNG...

####SpongyCastle

- Many people import this so can use latest BC, pretty much a jarjarlinks rename so no namespace clashes with BC. 
- If going to use best not to make default but still set staically so can use with direct sepcifier throughout app

####None?

- ~~N has removed all JCE security providers! See the [N changes doc](https://github.com/doridori/Android-Security-Reference/blob/master/changes/N.md)~~ As mentioned in the link this information was removed after the annoucement!

##Updating platform Provider from your app

See (Updating Your Security Provider to Protect Against SSL Exploits)[http://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-gms-provider.html]. Not clear if updates `BoringSSL` or just the Java `AndroidOpenSSL` SPI (or both).
