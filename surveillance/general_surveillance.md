#General Surveillance

Surveillance of an individual via their mobile phone is something which is moving more and more into public conciousness, especially since the [Snowdon leaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present)) of 2013.

This is spoken about in the Bruce Schneier book [Data and Goliath](https://www.schneier.com/books/data_and_goliath/) and is pretty scary reading. I thought of surveillance via mobile as an active attack on the device, but the truth is its a lot more subtle and powerful than that, and really, if you carry a mobile device thats sometimes powered on (even just the once), your vulnerable to this stuff.
